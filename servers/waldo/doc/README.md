![Project Waldo](http://i59.tinypic.com/30sevf5.png)
============

The WALDO monitoring system is a real-time web application which allows a person to view the status of a connected rover. This software will communicate with a TANGO server connected to the given rover. Through a beautiful yet powerful interface, people will be easily able to control a given rover at their fingertips.

There will be three levels of access for the application {anonymous, registered, and admin}

Core Features
============

- Provide semi-supervision to the rover through an easy interface [Tell the rover "Do not hit those rocks"]
- View Current Schedules & Plans [View plans generated by EUROPA]
- Control the rover automation [Start/Stop being autonomous]
- View the current camera [See what the rover sees]
- View the rover's enviroment [How dangerous is it out there? Whats the temperature? Where are the potential hazards?]
- Remotely control the rover from the application [Imagine showing your friend, "Hey I can control a rover from my phone"]
- Natural Language Interaction with the Rover [i.e. Say "Move this way"]
- Schedule/Collect data samples [i.e. Scientist says "I need information about rocks, analyze nearby rocks for the next week"]

Primary Goals
===========
- To have an accessible centralized control panel for managing a rover.

Technologies Intended to be used
============
- Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Socket.io
