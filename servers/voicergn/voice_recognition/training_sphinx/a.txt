They were supposed to move right.
He was ordered to move left.
Trevor was moving left.
Trevor,move right.
Trevor,move left.
Trevor,move backward.
Trevor was to my left.
The car was moving in backward direction.
It's your move.
Trevor helped me move.
We'd better get a move on.
Sometimes you have to go backward before you can clearly see how to move forward.
I look forward to see Trevor again.
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
Trevor fell backward.
It never occurred to me that he was the right man in the right place.
To have a right to do a thing is not at all the same as to be right in doing it.
The time is always right to do whatâ€™s right.
Trevor,move forward one step.
