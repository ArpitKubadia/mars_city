*Overview*
----------

.. Provides a brief overview of the package defined as a result of the
.. requirements elicitation process.


General Description
===================

Problem Statement
-----------------

The magnetosphere around the Earth protects us to certain extent, from the 
constant bombardment by charged particles from the sun. But, Much of Marsâ€™ 
atmosphere, on the other hand, is exposed directly to these fast-moving 
particles from the sun and the effects of solar flares. These storms of 
solar radiation can disrupt satellite communication, resource information, 
electrical power, and radar. Energy in the form of hard x-rays can also 
damage space craft electronics. The module aims to forecst such events
and issue relevant warning.

Functional Description
----------------------

The goal of the module is to provide a Neural Network implementation trained
using local database to be constructed. This trained Neural Net can then be 
interfaced with the Tango to issue a warning based on the type of solar flare.


User objectives
---------------

Describe all the users and their expectations for this package

Constraints
-----------

Although, the archive data for the training is readily available in [1]. 
The module is constrained by the continued availability of functional data
from the respective satellites.


*Functional Requirements*
====================================

.. This section lists the functional requirements in ranked order. Functional
.. requirements describe the possible effects of a software system, in other
.. words, what the system must accomplish. Other kinds of requirements (such as
.. interface requirements, performance requirements, or reliability requirements)
.. describe how the system accomplishes its functional requirements.
.. Each functional requirement should be specified in a format similar to the
.. following.:

.. Requirement
.. -----------

.. Description
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Criticality
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~

.. * High | Normal | Low

.. Dependency
.. ~~~~~~~~~~
.. Indicate if this requirement is dependant on another.


Interface Requirements
==========================

.. This section describes how the software interfaces with other software products
.. or users for input or output. Examples of such interfaces include library
.. routines, token streams, shared memory, data streams, and so forth.

*User Interfaces*
-----------------------

.. Describes how this product interfaces with the user.

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

A validation set of data will be maintained for the diagnostic requirements.


Software Interfaces
-------------------

Communication Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module is to be implementhed as a Python Tango server, which issues 
appropriate warnings in case of forecasted Solar storm. 


Development and Test Factors
============================

Standards Compliance
--------------------

The Software Engineering Practices Guidelines for the ERAS Project in [3] to be followed.


Planning
--------

The planned steps for the design and implementation of the model :

1. Variable selection
2. Data collection
3. Data preprocessing
4. Training and validation sets
5. Neural network paradigms
6. Evaluation criteria
7. Neural network training
8. Implementation

This procedure is not a single-pass one, and may require the revisiting of 
previous steps especially between training and variable selection. Although, 
the implementation step is listed as last one, it is being given careful 
consideration prior to collecting data.



Use-Cases
=========

Use Case: Data collection and integration
-----------------------------------------

The main focus is Data colection and preprocessing.

Actors
~~~~~~
Raw data, local database

Priority
~~~~~~~~
High

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The raw data (txt files) must be downloaded on lacal machine.

Basic Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The raw data from the warehouse in [1] is to be parsed and the data to be 
stored on local database (preferably using Mysql ). The data collected from 
the txt files will be integrated in database using the date as key. An example 
of the :term:`DSD` file is in [5]. Using this:

The following feature sets will be extarcted 

1. Radio flux
2. :term:`SESC` Sunspot number
3. Sunspot area 
4. New regions
5. X-ray background flux
6. C-forecast
7. M-forecast
8. X-forecast

The database will then be seperated into training and validation sets to be used 
for the neural network training.


Alternate Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although, it was initially thought of using image data from :term:`SDO` in [4]. But,
it is presently generating about 1.5TB of data daily and even the downsampled images
would require immense processing power and bandwidth (SDO is receiving about 700Mb every
36 secs). Such processing power is not currently available for this implementation.Still, 
attempts wil be made to find any source of processed data access points or APIs which may 
provide us the preprocessed data.


Postconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The database split into training and validation sets.




Use Case: Neural network training
---------------------------------
The focus will be to train the neural network to classify the Solar flares.

Actors
~~~~~~
Neural network, local database

Priority
~~~~~~~~
High

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The training database must be available.

Basic Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the training database, four different Neural networks will be trained
where each neural net will be trained to classify the features into a different
class ( classes to be trained for X, M, C, A&B ). Each of these neural nets will
be trained for one class only. The extracted feature set in the database will be
used to identify the class as the output.

The following Neural Network paradigms will be considered :

1. number of hidden layers
2. number of hidden neurons
3. transfer functions  

Additional factors considered for the training :

1. number of training iterations
2. learning rate
3. momentum

After the training, the validation set will be used to verify the performance
for the neural network.


Alternate Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternate course, a neural network consisting of multiple outputs to
classify the features into the respective classes can be trained. Based on
the input feature set, the output will be the corresponding class. The 
performance of both the implementations can be analysed to identify the 
most suitable solution.

Postconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A trained neural network implementation.




Use Case: Solar storm warning
-----------------------------

Actors
~~~~~~
Trained neural network as server, 
client that responds to warning

Priority
~~~~~~~~
Normal

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The neural network has access to input data feed.

Basic Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input features would be fed to the trained neural network. As the network has 
already been trained offline, the implemented neural network should be able to 
provide fast response. In case of a warning, the relevant warning will be issued 
specifying the type of forecast.

Alternate Course
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None

Postconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None
